minibatterylogger
=================

MiniBatteryLogger is a Mac OS X application that monitors your laptopâ€™s battery, traces the graph of
charge and current over time, compares your battery with other users, logs relevant power events and
alerts you with Growl notifications.

Since I am no longer maintaining this project, I am releasing it as open source so people can still
fork it and add support for new models and recent OSs.
